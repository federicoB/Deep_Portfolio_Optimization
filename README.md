# Deep_Portfolio_Optimization

This is the code used in the research work I did for my master thesis with the title "Deep Learning Methods for Portfolio Optimization".

Given a dataframe of assets prices we first generate the optimal portfolio allocation thought Markowitz theory, 
then we train a Temporal Convolutional Network targeting this optimal allocation.

This allows the user to have flexibility in the return-risk trade off wanted.
